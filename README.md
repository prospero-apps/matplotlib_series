Basics of matplotlib tutorial - blog post series

## matplotlib Part 1 – Introduction to Matplotlib
Matplotlib is a cross-platform data visualization library. It’s used to visualize data and the results of all sorts of computations. Matplotlib is mainly used for static 2D and 3D graphs.

## matplotlib Part 2 – A Basic Matplotlib Example
In the previous part of the Matplotlib series we created the matplotlib folder in Jupyter Notebook. Let’s add a notebook now.

## matplotlib Part 3 – The Elements of A Graph
In the previous part of the Matplotlib series we created a basic graph. It consists of a figure with just one axis on it. In this part we’ll add some elements to the graph so that it’s slightly less basic.

## matplotlib Part 4 – Multiple Axes
But what if we wanted each function to be plotted in its own coordinate space? Fortunately, we can add as many Axes as needed.

## matplotlib Part 5 – Adding Axes to the Figure
In this part of the Matplotlib series we’ll see how to add Axes instances to a figure.

## matplotlib Part 6 – Line Properties
In the previous part of the Matplotlib series we were adding Axes to the figure. Today let’s concentrate on a single axis, and in particular on the most important line properties like color, width and style.

## matplotlib Part 7 – Axis Range
In this part of the Matplotlib series we’ll be talking about axis ranges.

## matplotlib Part 8 – Axis Labels and Title
In the previous part of the Matplotlib series we were talking about axis ranges. In this part we’ll see how to add a title and axis labels for each axis so that we actually know what it represents.

## matplotlib Part 9 – The Legend
In the previous part of the Matplotlib series we were talking about the title and axis labels. Today let’s see how to add a legend to the graph.

## matplotlib Part 10 – Text Annotations
In the previous part of the Matplotlib series we were talking about the legend. Today we’ll learn how to add text annotations to the graph.

## matplotlib Part 11 – Axis Ticks
In the previous part of the Matplotlib series we were talking about text annotations. In this part we’ll be talking about axis ticks.

## matplotlib Part 12 – Grids
In the previous part of the Matplotlib series we were talking about axis ticks. Today’s topic is closely related to this. A graph will become more readable if you add grid lines to it.

## matplotlib Part 13 – Sharing Axis Scale
Sometimes you may want to share axis scale across multiple axes.

## matplotlib Part 14 – Twin Axes
Sometimes you may want to display two independent axes at the same time, like for example when you plot two different quantities on one graph.

## matplotlib Part 15 – Insets
You can create axes that sit inside other axes. You can come across examples of axes that display magnified portions of the main axis. We call such axes insets.

## matplotlib Part 16 – The Subplot2grid Layout Manager
Most of the time we’ve been creating figures and axes using the plt.subplots method. Today let’s have a look at a layout manager that can help us with it a little.

## matplotlib Part 17 – Scatter Plots with the plot Method
So far we’ve been only using line plots. But there’s a great variety of plots we can use in matplotlib. Let’s first talk about scatter plots.

## matplotlib Part 18 – Scatter Plots with the scatter Method
In the previous article we were using the plot method to create scatter plots. But there’s a specialized and more powerful method to do that. In this article we’re going to be using it.

## matplotlib Part 19 – Histograms
In this article we’ll have a look at histograms, binnings and density plots.

## matplotlib Part 20 – 2D Histograms
In the previous article we were talking about histograms. Today we’ll be talking about two-dimensional histograms, which we create using the hist2d method.

## matplotlib Part 21 – Errorbars
In this article we’ll be talking about errorbars. We use them to add information about possible errors or uncertainties.

## matplotlib Part 22 – Colormap Plots
In this article we’ll be talking about colormap plots. These are used to represent three-dimensional data in 2D. The x and y axes are represented by position in a 2D coordinate system whereas the value of z is represented by a color.

## matplotlib Part 23 – Contour Plots
In the previous article we were talking about color maps. Today we’ll be talking about contour maps, which are pretty similar. Instead of the pcolor method, you use the contour method.

## matplotlib Part 24 – Colorbars
In the preceding articles we were talking about colormap plots and contour plots. We know that the colors represent the Z values, whereas the X and Y values are represented by position in a 2D coordinate system. But what do the colors mean? What values of Z do they correspond to? In order to make it clear, we should add a color legend, or a colorbar.

## matplotlib Part 25 – The Colorbar for Scatter Plots
Some time ago we were talking about scatter plots. In the previous article we were talking about colorbars. In this article we’ll use a colorbar for the colors of the points.

## matplotlib Part 26 – Axes3D and 3D Projection
2D plots are great and in most cases they’re all you need. But if you need a 3D plot, matplotlib has this functionality too. In this lecture we’ll be talking about the basics of 3D plotting in matplotlib.

## matplotlib Part 27 – 3D Points and Lines
Now that you know what 3D projection is, it’s time to actually plot something. Let’s start with something simple like 3D points and lines. As you remember, in 2D we use the ax.plot method to plot lines and the ax.scatter method to plot points. They both have counterparts in 3D, ax.plot3D and ax.scatter3D respectively.

## matplotlib Part 28 – 3D Contour Plots
Today we’ll be plotting contours in 3D. To this end we need the contour method. This method works in a similar way as in 2D. You can specify the stride, as well as the projection direction.

## matplotlib Part 29 – Wireframes and Surface Plots
Today we’ll be talking about wireframe and surface plots. We’ll be using our example from the previous lecture and modify it.
