Basics of matplotlib tutorial - blog post series

## matplotlib Part 1 – Introduction to Matplotlib
Matplotlib is a cross-platform data visualization library. It’s used to visualize data and the results of all sorts of computations. Matplotlib is mainly used for static 2D and 3D graphs.

## matplotlib Part 2 – A Basic Matplotlib Example
In the previous part of the Matplotlib series we created the matplotlib folder in Jupyter Notebook. Let’s add a notebook now.

## matplotlib Part 3 – The Elements of A Graph
In the previous part of the Matplotlib series we created a basic graph. It consists of a figure with just one axis on it. In this part we’ll add some elements to the graph so that it’s slightly less basic.

## matplotlib Part 4 – Multiple Axes
But what if we wanted each function to be plotted in its own coordinate space? Fortunately, we can add as many Axes as needed.

## matplotlib Part 5 – Adding Axes to the Figure
In this part of the Matplotlib series we’ll see how to add Axes instances to a figure.

## matplotlib Part 6 – Line Properties
In the previous part of the Matplotlib series we were adding Axes to the figure. Today let’s concentrate on a single axis, and in particular on the most important line properties like color, width and style.

## matplotlib Part 8 – Axis Labels and Title
In the previous part of the Matplotlib series we were talking about axis ranges. In this part we’ll see how to add a title and axis labels for each axis so that we actually know what it represents.

## matplotlib Part 9 – The Legend
In the previous part of the Matplotlib series we were talking about the title and axis labels. Today let’s see how to add a legend to the graph.

## matplotlib Part 10 – Text Annotations
In the previous part of the Matplotlib series we were talking about the legend. Today we’ll learn how to add text annotations to the graph.
